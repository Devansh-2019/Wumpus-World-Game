# Serene 🌿 — AI Mental Health Chatbot

Serene is an intelligent AI-powered mental health chatbot designed to provide empathetic emotional support and guided therapeutic conversations.

The project combines multiple Artificial Intelligence concepts including:

- 🧠 Intelligent Agents (PEAS Model)
- 🔍 Bi-Directional Search
- 🧬 Genetic Algorithms
- 🤖 LLM Integration (Groq + Llama 3.1)
- 💬 Emotion Detection & Conversational AI

The chatbot analyzes user emotions, plans emotional progression toward a calm mental state, and generates compassionate responses dynamically.

---

# 🚀 Features

- Emotion detection from user messages
- AI-powered empathetic conversation
- Crisis support detection
- Emotional state tracking
- Therapy path planning using Bi-Directional Search
- Genetic Algorithm optimized responses
- Groq API integration using Llama 3.1
- Session-based memory
- REST API backend with Flask
- Fallback response system when API is unavailable

---

# 🧠 AI Concepts Used

## 1. Intelligent Agent (PEAS Model)

The chatbot is implemented as a Goal-Based Intelligent Agent.

### PEAS Description

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| Performance Measure | Move user toward calm emotional state |
| Environment | User conversation & emotional context |
| Actuators | Therapeutic responses & coping strategies |
| Sensors | Emotion detection & sentiment analysis |

---

## 2. Bi-Directional Search

The emotional state graph is traversed using Bi-Directional Search to find the shortest therapeutic path from the current emotional state to the goal state (`calm`).

### Example Emotional Flow

```text
depressed → sad → neutral → okay → calm
````

This allows the chatbot to:

* Plan emotional progression
* Suggest next therapeutic action
* Track conversation improvement

---

## 3. Genetic Algorithm

A Genetic Algorithm evolves the chatbot’s response strategy dynamically.

The GA optimizes:

* Tone
* Empathy level
* Therapeutic technique
* Question strategy

## `agent.py`

Core AI agent implementation.

Responsible for:

* Perception
* Emotional state classification
* Planning
* Response generation
* Maintaining conversation history

### Processing Cycle

```text
Perceive → Update State → Plan → Act
```

---

## `bidirectional_search.py`

Implements the Bi-Directional Search algorithm.

Used to:

* Find shortest emotional path
* Suggest therapy transitions
* Explore emotional graph efficiently

---

## `genetic_algorithm.py`

Implements the Genetic Algorithm system.

Features:
